    <p>My name is Andrew McManus, and Iâ€™m a Chicago-based software engineer. As a developer I've created interactive apps using Javascript, Python, Django, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, React, and various REST web APIs. I also have a background in audio programming, music education, and digital marketing for music ensembles. I've programmed sound creation apps in Max, CSound, SPAT and other object-oriented languages, and I've used these to derive music from raw neurological experiment data.</p>
